# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Things to do:
- add/fix semantic HTML elements
- logical flow to HTML elements; structure correct
- image elements have alt attributes âˆš
- heading attributes fall in sequential order
- title elements concise and descriptive

- when browser changes sizes, text doesn't always fit in its boxes (nav doesn't, SEO, etc content falls out of box)
- alt text for hero bg?

## What I've changed so far

### Overall Appearance
1. Proper indentation (not complete)
2. Added title elements (to HTML and CSS)
3. Changed head title to one more reflective of website
4. Grouped sections together

### Navigation
- header tag instead of div in HTML; "header" instead of ".header" in CSS
- linked nav header title to homepage (or should I do the "/" and be linked to the index?)
- nav tag instead of div
- linked seo to its proper id

### Content
- sections instead of div
- added id to link SEO with navigation
- alt text to images; images are decorative but also worth explaining

### Benefits
- alt text to images; since images are purely decorative just used alt=""
