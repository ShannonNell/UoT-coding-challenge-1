# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Things to do:
- add/fix semantic HTML elements
- logical flow to HTML elements; structure correct
- image elements have alt attributes
- heading attributes fall in sequential order
- title elements concise and descriptive

## What I've changed so far

### Overall Appearance
1. Proper indentation (not complete)
2. Added title elements (to HTML and CSS)

### Header
- changed title name to one more representative of the website
