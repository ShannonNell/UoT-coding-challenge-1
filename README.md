# Challenge 1: Code Refactor

***

## Description:

This is code refactored for UoT's Coding Bootcamp challenge assignment 1. Code has been cleaned, condensed, and organized to follow accessibility standards.

Semantic HTML elements were added and code was orgnaized into a more logical flow. Image elements had alt attributes added to assist screen readers and in case image fails to load. In addition, title element was changed to something more representative of the webpage. 

To assist in ease of reading code, comments were added to describe elements in both HTML and CSS.
